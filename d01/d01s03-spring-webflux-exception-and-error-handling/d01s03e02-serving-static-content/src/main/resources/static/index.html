        <p>
            By default Spring Boot will serve static content from a directory called /static (or /public or /resources
            or /META-INF/resources) in the classpath or from the root of the ServletContext. It uses the ResourceHttpRequestHandler
            from Spring MVC so you can modify that behavior by adding your own WebMvcConfigurerAdapter and overriding the
            addResourceHandlers method.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a stand-alone web application the default servlet from the container is also enabled, and acts as a fallback,
            serving content from the root of the ServletContext if Spring decides not to handle it. Most of the time this
            will not happen (unless you modify the default MVC configuration) because Spring will always be able to handle
            requests through the DispatcherServlet.
